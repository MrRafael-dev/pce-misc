PC Engine / TurboGrafx-16 experiments.

Currently, there's only one file, which is a very simple example for displaying tiles and sprites on screen.
It's written for [WLA-DX](https://github.com/vhelin/wla-dx).

It works on [MAME](https://github.com/mamedev/mame) and [Ares](https://github.com/ares-emulator/ares), but still fails on [Mednafen](https://github.com/mednafen).
